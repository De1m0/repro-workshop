In the context of research, reproducibility refers to the ability to duplicate results of a study using the same data and methods. It ensures scientific integrity, as it allows others to verify findings and build upon existing work. Reproducibility can be achieved by documenting every step of the research process carefully, using version control systems for tracking changes, and employing tools for managing software environments and Workflow orchestration. Reproducibility is vital in scientific research, promoting transparency, fostering trust, and facilitating continual progress. Moreover, without reproducibility, research may lose its credibility and impact, as we cannot be certain that the results are reliable and accurate. Solving the problems that hinder reproducibility is crucial, which leads us to the problems we will try to understand today. What problems must we solve? copy&amp;paste mistakes inconsistent versions of code or data missing or incompatible software complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction What concepts must we know about? Dynamic documents Version control Software management Workflow orchestration What software must we know about? RMarkdown Git Docker Make To all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more. However, we had to decide on one set of tools. More important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor. What services will we use? Normally you work on your local computer. However, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups. Therefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud). Additionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (≠ Git) and GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub). What does self-paced mean? Self-paced learning is an educational approach that allows you to control the speed and the intensity of your learning. This means you can learn at your own rhythm, pausing, reviewing, and progressing when it suits you best. You are encouraged to actively engage with the material, explore the content, and try to solve problems on your own before seeking help. In this course, there’s no rigid schedule to follow. You’re free to come and go, and move through the content as you please. Remember, while it’s self-guided, you’re not alone - use the infoboxes, explanation follows in the next paragraph, and course leaders are available to assist if you encounter difficulties you can’t resolve on your own. It is a flexible and personal way of learning designed to support you on your learning journey. What are infoboxes? There are two types of infoboxes in this course. The first type is the Additional info box. These provide information to delve deeper into a topic and can be found throughout the course. Clicking on one of these boxes will take you to more in-depth material. The second type are ReproDude infoboxes. You will find these at least once in each chapter. If you have a question or get stuck, click on the relevant box in the chapter and you will be redirected to ReproDude, already informed about the corresponding topic. Ask what you want to know and have a conversation. To use this, you will need a ChatGPT account, a link to which can be found below. Additional info I am an additional infobox that provides you with additional material to educate you more deeply. Click on my sister boxes for more information. ReproDude I am ReproDude, so if you have a question or are stuck on a topic, click on the appropriate ReproDude box and ask there. You will need an account with ChatGPT to use me. What else should i know before I start? In this workshop we will go through many things, many of them complicated. The goal today is to understand what is possible and not to achieve a complete deep technical understanding. So be kind to others and yourself and try not to get frustrated, ReproDude and the workshop leaders are there to help you if necessary. Just as you set your own pace in this course, you can also decide which tasks you do in this course. There are two types of tasks: 1. The tasks marked in green are important and the workshop will not work if you skip any of these points or do them in the wrong order. 2. The tasks marked in blue are completely optional and are meant for trying out and experimenting. You can skip these tasks as you like. Questions? Comments? Notes? If you have any questions, comments, or notes regarding the workshop in general, you can share them on the following document: Workshop Feedback Setup!

Do you feel comfortable yet? Yes? Then let’s move on. If not, take as much time as you need and move on as soon as you want, I have no more Appointments today. Best practices? To give you a sense of how reproducibility can be increased, i will show you some best practices: Open the R folder. You should now see three different R files. Click on the file R/prepare_games.R Now try to understand the code. Which of these do you already do? What could you improve? You want to see more? Because it’s you (same thing but more complicated): Take a look at R/prepare_inflation A summary? To summarize this in an incomplete list: List requirements early Use relative locations Document relevant information Let’s talk about the last point. Does that mean that every piece of documentation has to be a mile long? No…. not necessarily. But how do I decide what should or should not be included in my documentation? Let’s make another list: What is standard does not have to be documented. What is easy needs only little documentation. What is consistent only has to be documented once. Great, now you’ve already finished the necessary! You want to go straight on? Let’s take a look at the extended goal first. Overview of the extended goal.
