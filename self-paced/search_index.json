What services will we use? Setup", " Getting Started What is reproducibility? TBD What problems must we solve? copy&amp;paste mistakes inconsistent versions of code or data missing or incompatible software complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction What concepts must we know about? Dynamic documents Version control Software management Workflow orchestration What software must we know about? RMarkdown Git Docker Make To all of these implementations there are alternatives e.g., Quarto, Jupyter, Singluarity, virtualenv, SnakeMake, and many more. However, we had to decide on one set of tools. More important is that you understand for what we use them, than you may replace them with whatever you favor. What services will we use? Normally you work on your local computer. However, in workshops this often leads to the issues of missing/outdated/broken software setups. Therefore, we suggest to use the prepared software environment we give you in form of Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud). Additionally, we will make heavy use of GitHub (≠ Git) and GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub).
